# Email Service Setup Guide

## ðŸ“§ Current Email System Status

### âœ… **What's Working:**
- **Email Collection**: User emails are captured in the email gate
- **Email Storage**: Emails stored in localStorage with plan data
- **API Endpoint**: `/api/send-email` serverless function created
- **Fallback Queue**: Emails queued locally if sending fails

### ðŸ”§ **What Needs Configuration:**

## 1. Production Email Service Integration

### Option A: SendGrid (Recommended)
```bash
npm install @sendgrid/mail
```

**Environment Variables in Vercel:**
```
SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_sendgrid_api_key_here
FROM_EMAIL=noreply@ruckingstart.com
```

**Setup Steps:**
1. Create SendGrid account
2. Verify sender email: `noreply@ruckingstart.com`
3. Generate API key
4. Add environment variables in Vercel dashboard

### Option B: Resend (Modern Alternative)
```bash
npm install resend
```

**Environment Variables:**
```
RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key_here
FROM_EMAIL=noreply@ruckingstart.com
```

### Option C: AWS SES
```bash
npm install @aws-sdk/client-ses
```

**Environment Variables:**
```
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_key
FROM_EMAIL=noreply@ruckingstart.com
```

## 2. Email Template Enhancement

The current system includes:
- âœ… Personalized greeting with user's name
- âœ… Plan URL included in email
- âœ… HTML and text versions
- âœ… Professional styling
- âœ… Call-to-action buttons

## 3. Email Analytics (Optional)

Track email engagement:
- Open rates
- Click-through rates
- Plan access rates

## 4. Current Email Queue System

**How it works:**
- If email sending fails, emails are stored in `localStorage` under `email_queue`
- Each email includes: timestamp, recipient, plan URL, status
- Can be processed later or used for manual sending

**Access queued emails:**
```javascript
const emailQueue = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('email_queue') || '[]');
console.log('Queued emails:', emailQueue);
```

## 5. Testing Email Functionality

### Development Testing:
- Emails are currently simulated (logged to console)
- Check browser console for email details
- Test different user flows

### Production Testing:
1. Configure email service (SendGrid/Resend)
2. Deploy updated function
3. Test with real email address
4. Monitor email delivery

## ðŸš€ Quick Setup for Production

1. **Choose email service** (SendGrid recommended)
2. **Add environment variables** in Vercel dashboard
3. **Update `/api/send-email.js`** with actual service integration
4. **Deploy and test**

## ðŸ“Š Email Analytics Dashboard (Future Enhancement)

Track:
- Total emails sent
- Plan access rate
- User engagement
- Popular plan types
